# CCS - Chinese Comprehension Scoring

Lets users compare their own comprehension level of Chinese against Chinese media in text form (books, transcripts, etc).

The user needs to provide a path to a text file storing their known vocabulary of unique Chinese characters and a path to a text file storing the media source of interest. CCS will then simply calculate the frequency of characters occuring in the media that are known to the user, and will then present the frequency as a percentage. 


### Later features to consider
Support for words. Upload a vocabulary file of words, use a segmentation library to segment the words in the media file and calculate known frequency.
Frequency plots of characters/words in the media file.
Overall difficulty score of book regardless of vocabulary.
Difficulty scores for predefined levels of proficiency, e.g., compare against HSK 1-6 (old) and HSK 1-9 (new)
