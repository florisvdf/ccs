# CCS - Chinese Comprehension Scoring

Users can score their own reading comprehension based on their vocabulary against a 
media source for both words or for characters. Additionally, users can obtain a 
vocabulary list of words/characters based on a media source and a desired comprehension 
score. 

If you don't have a file of your current vocabulary stored anywhere, but you know your 
reading ability in terms of HSK levels (new or old), you can instead choose to score the 
media source for various levels of HSK. This will output a text file that stores a 
comprehension score for each HSK level, both new and old.

In addition, you may be interested in knowing which words to prioritize in order to 
read your book at a certain level of reading comprehension. `ccs` can generate a word
or character vocabulary to learn in order to reach that score.
